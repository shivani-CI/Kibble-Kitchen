# Kibble-Kitchen (Capstone Project)


Kibble Kitchen is an online platform designed to help dog owners plan nutritious meals for their furry companions.

Kibble Kitchen goes beyond just offering recipes; it empowers dog owners to take control of their pet's nutrition with easy-to-follow meal plans, detailed ingredient lists, and portion guides based on breed, size, and dietary requirements. Users can save favourite recipes, create custom meal plans and even track their dog's nutritional intake over time. With a focus on natural, balanced meals, Kibble Kitchen is the go-to resource for pet parents dedicated to giving their dogs the best possible care through thoughtfull, personalised feeding.
